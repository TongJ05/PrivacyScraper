Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  18.1  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.18.2  Arbitration Rules and Forum.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail legal@snagajob.com.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 18.3  Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  18.4  Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  18.5  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THESE TERMS.19.7  Notice.  You are responsible for providing your most current e-mail address in your profile, on the Website and in the Application.  If the last e-mail address you provided to Snagajob is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by the Terms, Snagajob’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give notice to Snagajob via e-mail at the following address: legal@snagajob.com. 19.8  Waiver.  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.19.9  Severability.  If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.19.10  Export Control.

Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  18.1  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.18.2  Arbitration Rules and Forum.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail legal@snagajob.com.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 18.3  Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  18.4  Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  18.5  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

If the last e-mail address you provided to Snagajob is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by the Terms, Snagajob’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give notice to Snagajob via e-mail at the following address: legal@snagajob.com. 19.8  Waiver.  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.19.9  Severability.

Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  18.1  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.18.2  Arbitration Rules and Forum.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail legal@snagajob.com.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 18.3  Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  18.4  Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  18.5  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  18.1  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.18.2  Arbitration Rules and Forum.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail legal@snagajob.com.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 18.3  Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  18.4  Waiver of Jury Trial.  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  18.5  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

General.These Employer Terms of Use will apply to and govern (i) each Sales Order (other than Sales Orders described in the last sentence of this Section 1(a)) entered into between Customer and Snagajob.com, Inc. (“Snag”) and the services described in such Sales Orders as fully as if the provisions of these Employer Terms of Use were set forth in their entirety in each such Sales Order, and (ii) each other order of services by Customer on or through the Snagajob website without a Sales Order (“Website Orders”) and the services covered by such Website Orders. The services described in Sales Orders and covered by Website Orders are referred to herein collectively as the “Services.” By contracting for Services or using the Snag site, as defined below, Customer also agrees to comply with and be bound by the Snagajob Terms of Use found at snagajob.com/terms. These Employer Terms of Use do not apply to or govern any Sales Orders or Services which are governed by a Master Services Agreement, or any similar written agreement, signed by Customer and Snag.2. Services.(a) Customer and Snag agree that Snag will provide or make available to Customer the services or other offerings described in each Sales Order or covered by each Website Order, as applicable, for the service period(s) specified in, or to the extent otherwise provided in, such Sales Order or the applicable Website Order Terms (the “Service Periods”).

Customer agrees that Snag is not responsible for, and does not provide or control, those Third-Party Offerings. Snag encourages Customer to read the legal notices and privacy policies of each and every provider of such Third-Party Offering. Customer’s use of a Third-Party Offering will be subject to the terms of use, privacy policy, and any other applicable terms and conditions, required by the provider of such Third-Party Offering. Snag makes available Third-Party Offerings only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Offerings, and Customer accesses and/or uses all such Third-Party Offerings at its own risk.(c) In connection with purchasing the Services, Customer will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining at its expense all computer hardware, software and communications equipment and connections, including mobile devices and wireless data services, required for Customers to access the Snag Site and/or the App and to access and use the applicable Services. By using the App, Customer consents to receive, at its cost, electronic communications from Snag.(d) Snag reserves the right to make modifications to the Services, the Snag Site, the App and/or the Software during the term of any applicable Sales Order or Website Order; provided that such modifications do not have a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services.3.

Payment for Services.(a) Customer agrees to pay for all of the Services described in each Sales Order and covered by each Website Order at the prices and rates, plus taxes, specified in such Sales Order or by the applicable Website Order Terms, as applicable, and without offset or deduction. Unless another payment method or other payment terms are agreed to by Customer and Snagajob in a Sales Order, all such payments will be due and must be paid within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. If any such payment is not paid when due hereunder, Snag may suspend the delivery of Services to Customer until payment is made, without extending the term of the Services, and Customer agrees to pay Snag interest on such overdue payment at one percent (1%) per month, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, and to reimburse Snag on demand for all costs of collection incurred by Snag, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.(b) Customer will be responsible for and agrees to pay all sales, use, value-added, excise and other taxes, if any, relating to the Sales Order(s), the Website Order(s) or the Services, other than taxes based on Snag’s net income.(c) Snag will have the right to modify the prices and rates it charges for the Services in connection with the auto-renewing of Sales Orders or Website Orders by providing not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice to Customer.

The parties agree that the sole and exclusive venue for the resolution of any disputes hereunder will be the federal or state courts in Fairfax County, Virginia, and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts.12.5 Except with regard to payment obligations, in no event will either Party be liable or responsible to the other Party, or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control, including acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest.12.6 Neither Party may assign, or otherwise transfer, any of its obligations and rights under the terms of this Agreement except that Snag Work may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement as follows: (i) to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Snag Work’s assets, (ii) to an entity that Snag Work owns or that is owned by Snag Work’s parent company, or (iii) with the advanced written consent of the other party.12.7 The failure of either Party to exercise any of its rights or to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement on any occasion will not be a waiver of such right or provision, nor will it prejudice the right of such Party to enforce such provision at any subsequent time.12.8 In case any one or more of the provisions, subsections, or sentences contained in this Agreement will, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.12.9 These Terms and the Agreement, including its exhibits, constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, oral or written, relating to the subject matter herein. These Terms and the Agreement may be amended from time to time by Snag Work and Snag Work shall post notice of such amendment on its website. Exhibit A: Scheduling Code of Conduct A “Posted Shift” is defined as one where a Client, using the Snag Work web application, confirms a location, date, start and end time, and position for which Client needs Snag Work to find a qualified Worker. A “Scheduled Shift Amount” is the amount of money due per the terms of the Posted Shift and Exhibit B. Snag Work will offer the Posted Shifts to the Workers. If Snag Work has not confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift, no payment will be due from Client for such Posted Shift and Snag will have no responsibility or liability to Client for such Posted Shift. If Snag Work has confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift and the shift is not scheduled to begin within 24 hours, Client may cancel the Posted Shift without penalty. If Snag Work has confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift and the shift is scheduled to begin within 24 to 2 hours and Client wishes to cancel the Posted Shift, Client will pay 50 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. If Client cancels the confirmed Posted Shift within 2 hours of shift start, Client will pay 100 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. In the event that a Worker has begun working a Posted Shift and Client sends the Worker home before the Posted Shift is scheduled to end, Client will pay 100 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. If Client wishes to extend a Posted Shift for a Worker after Worker has begun working and Worker has agreed to the extension, Client will pay for total amount worked by Worker instead of Scheduled Shift Amount, as determined by the number of hours actually worked and the terms of Exhibit A. Worker is under no obligation to work beyond the end time set forth in the Posted Shift. Within 36 hours of receipt of notification to approve a Worker’s hours, Client will review, revise as needed, and approve the Worker’s hours. If Client does not review and approve a Worker’s hours within 36 hours, Snag Work will assume the Worker’s reported hours reflect actual hours worked, will bill Client accordingly, and Client will accept the charges.

Snag Work Terms of ServiceThese Snag Work Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to and govern each Snag Work Sales Order Agreement (“Agreement”) entered into by and between Snag Work LLC (“Snag Work”) and the Client indicated on the Snag Work Sales Order Agreement (“Client”). 1. Services and Payment1.1 Client may procure from Snag Work on an as needed and as available basis the following services with respect to temporary workers (“Workers” or “Contractors”): recruitment, onboarding, orientation and staffing (the “Services”) at the locations agreed upon by Client and Snag Work. Services will be provided in accordance with Exhibit A (“Scheduling Code of Conduct”) and the parties agree to comply with the Scheduling Code of Conduct.1.2 Client agrees to pay for all of the Services at the prices and rates specified in the Agreement without offset or deduction. All such payments will be billed to Client’s credit card weekly or paid by ACH transfer weekly. If any such payment is not paid when due hereunder, Client agrees to pay Snag Work interest on such overdue payment at the rate of 1 1/2% per month, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, and to reimburse Client on demand for all costs of collection incurred by Snag Work, including, without limitation, its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. 2. Independent Contractor Relationship2.1 The relationship between Snag Work and Client is that of independent contractors. Nothing herein is intended to or will be deemed or construed to create a joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between the parties for any purpose, or to impose upon the parties any of the duties or responsibilities of partners, joint venturers, agents or joint employers. Neither party has the authority to make any representation, contract or commitment on behalf of the other unless otherwise expressly authorized in a written document signed by both parties.2.2 Nothing in the Agreement or these Terms will prohibit Snag Work from performing similar services for entities other than Client during the term of this Agreement, so long as Snag Work’s actions do not otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement. 3.

The parties agree that Workers dictate their own availability, and the Workers have full discretion as to whether to accept shifts offered by Client through Snag Work. It is expressly agreed that Snag Work retains control over hiring and compensating Workers who perform Services pursuant to this Agreement.4.3 In the event that Client hires a Worker for a full or part time employment position with Client, Client agrees to notify Snag Work immediately and pay Snag Work a cost per hire amount as specified in the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or these Terms, if Client hires a Worker for either a full time or part time position, Snag Work will be released of all legal and financial responsibilities with respect to that Worker and its relationship with Client, effective the date the Worker is hired by the Client.4.4 Client acknowledges and agrees that it will not place any Workers at a location subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 5. Confidentiality5.1 “Confidential Information” as used in will mean information disclosed by a Party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (”Receiving Party”) that (1) if disclosed in tangible or electronic form bears a confidentiality legend, (2) if disclosed orally is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or is information of a type or nature that a reasonable person would understand is confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information will include, without limitation, (a) concepts and ideas relating to the development and distribution of content in any medium or to the current, future and proposed products or services of the Disclosing Party or its subsidiaries or affiliates; (b) trade secrets (including but not limited to recipes and product formulations), drawings, inventions, know-how, software programs, and software source documents; (c) information regarding plans for research, development, new service offerings or products, marketing and selling, business plans, business forecasts, budgets and unpublished financial statements, licenses and distribution arrangements, prices and costs, suppliers and customers; (d) existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the parties; and (e) any information regarding the skills and compensation of employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party or its subsidiaries or affiliates.5.2 Receiving Party agrees that all Confidential Information furnished to it by the Disclosing Party and its designated representatives, whether orally or by means of written material, and including Confidential Information furnished prior to the date of this Agreement, (a) will be deemed proprietary and will be held by the Receiving Party in strict confidence; (b) will not be disclosed or revealed or shared with any other person except for the Receiving Party’s professional advisors in connection with any defense of claim with respect to an alleged disclosure of any such Confidential Information or those individuals or entities specifically authorized by the Disclosing Party in advance; and (c) will not be used other than for purposes of, and in connection with, the performance of the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement.5.3 A Receiving Party’s obligations as set forth in this Section 5 will not apply with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information that: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the Receiving Party; (b) entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party, subsequent to the time it was communicated to Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (c) was in the Receiving Party’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (d) was rightfully communicated to the Receiving Party free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (e) was developed by employees or agents of the Disclosing Party independently of and without reference to any information communicated to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (f) was communicated by the Disclosing Party to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence (g) was not labeled or identified as “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party prior to or at the time of disclosure to the Receiving Party, unless such information is of a type or nature that a reasonable person would understand is confidential.5.4 All such material and any copies thereof will be promptly returned upon request of the Disclosing Party, or if agreed between Snag Work and Client, the Receiving Party may be permitted to Destroy such materials (and copies thereof). If Receiving Party Destroys such materials, the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information as necessary for compliance with laws and its data retention policies, provided that such copy will remain subject to the nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions of this Agreement. For information in electronic form or intangible media, “Destroy” as used in this Section means to delete or remove data from a file, file system or database software using the standard delete features of such software. The obligation to Destroy does not require the deletion or removal of data from backup or archival files that are only used for system recovery or data restoration purposes.5.5 Each Party agrees that the obligations under this Section are continuing and will survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of 2 years.5.6 The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach of the undertaking to maintain the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information will cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and such Party will have the right to take such action it deems necessary to protect its rights hereunder, including without limitation, injunctive relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies as may be available to that party at law or equity for a breach or threatened breach of this or any other Section of this Agreement. 6. Safety and Compliance with Laws6.1 Client will be solely responsible, at its own cost, to: (i) provide, in good condition, all tools, safety and work equipment, supplies, and specialized clothing that may be required for the performance of work by Workers in the normal course of proving the Services (but not equipment required by Contractor due to his or her individual needs); (ii) provide a work environment compliant with all applicable OSHA and other workplace safety requirements and provide information and training with respect to any hazardous substances or conditions to which Workers may be exposed at the worksite, as required by law; (iii) assign Workers only to attended premises; (iv) direct, control, supervise and safeguard its premises, processes and systems; and (v) direct and supervise Workers when handling cash, checks, keys, credit cards, merchandise, confidential or trade secret information, negotiable instruments or other valuables.

A “Scheduled Shift Amount” is the amount of money due per the terms of the Posted Shift and Exhibit B. Snag Work will offer the Posted Shifts to the Workers. If Snag Work has not confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift, no payment will be due from Client for such Posted Shift and Snag will have no responsibility or liability to Client for such Posted Shift. If Snag Work has confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift and the shift is not scheduled to begin within 24 hours, Client may cancel the Posted Shift without penalty. If Snag Work has confirmed a Worker for Client’s Posted Shift and the shift is scheduled to begin within 24 to 2 hours and Client wishes to cancel the Posted Shift, Client will pay 50 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. If Client cancels the confirmed Posted Shift within 2 hours of shift start, Client will pay 100 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. In the event that a Worker has begun working a Posted Shift and Client sends the Worker home before the Posted Shift is scheduled to end, Client will pay 100 percent of the Scheduled Shift Amount. If Client wishes to extend a Posted Shift for a Worker after Worker has begun working and Worker has agreed to the extension, Client will pay for total amount worked by Worker instead of Scheduled Shift Amount, as determined by the number of hours actually worked and the terms of Exhibit A. Worker is under no obligation to work beyond the end time set forth in the Posted Shift. Within 36 hours of receipt of notification to approve a Worker’s hours, Client will review, revise as needed, and approve the Worker’s hours. If Client does not review and approve a Worker’s hours within 36 hours, Snag Work will assume the Worker’s reported hours reflect actual hours worked, will bill Client accordingly, and Client will accept the charges.

Snagajob Privacy Policy   Last updated: January 5, 2023 The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers should carefully review the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Location Information. When you use the Services, we and our service providers may collect precise location information (in accordance with your device settings and permissions) as well as collect general location information from your computer or mobile device. “General” location information means information to identify the city and state in which your device is located based on its IP address. This information allows us to give you access to content that varies based on your general location (e.g., nearby locations or delivery status). We will ask your permission before collecting your precise GPS location information. In such instances, we may use your precise geo-location information to provide customized services, content, and other information that may be of interest to you. Please note that precise geolocation information is considered “sensitive personal information” under certain privacy laws, and we process this information in accordance with applicable legal requirements. You can disable geolocation tracking on your device. For more information, see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies.

We may also collect this kind of information when you interact with email messages or other communications we send you. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use our Services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email; they are designed to collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates, measure the popularity of our Services and associated advertising, and access cookies. We and our vendors (including Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics) also use these technologies and the information collected by them for advertising and data analytics purposes.

We may also receive results of background and identity verification checks. Log-in Services and Social Network Information.

To do this our technology partners may disclose data, such as your browsing patterns, geo-location and device identifiers, and will match the information of the browser and devices that appear to be used by the same person.3. Online and Mobile App AdvertisingA. Online AdvertisingWe may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as  Google’s ad services, and others) on our Services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Services and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches and browsing activity. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Adobe Audience Manager, visit adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising, or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. To generally update your cookies settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to disable cookies altogether, please consult your web browser settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our Services.For additional ways to opt out of targeted advertising activities under applicable law, see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below. Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for each device—and each browser on each device—through which you access our Services. In addition, the opt-outs do not apply to advertisements in mobile applications. See the “Mobile App Advertising” section below to learn how to opt out of mobile app advertising.B. Mobile App AdvertisingWe may use third-party service providers to deliver ads on other mobile apps or for mobile app analytics based on your interactions on our platform.  Each operating system (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the use of advertising identifiers for tailored in-application advertisements. Because we do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for information on opting out of this use of your advertising identifiers.C. Notice Concerning Do Not TrackDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about Do Not Track. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.4. How We Disclose Information We CollectWe and our service providers disclose the information we collect from and about you for the following business and operational purposes:Employers and Vendors.

Snagajob Privacy Policy   Last updated: January 5, 2023 The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers should carefully review the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Online and Mobile App AdvertisingA. Online AdvertisingWe may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as  Google’s ad services, and others) on our Services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Services and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches and browsing activity. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.

Mobile App AdvertisingWe may use third-party service providers to deliver ads on other mobile apps or for mobile app analytics based on your interactions on our platform.  Each operating system (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the use of advertising identifiers for tailored in-application advertisements. Because we do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for information on opting out of this use of your advertising identifiers.C. Notice Concerning Do Not TrackDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about Do Not Track. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.4.

Snagajob Privacy Policy   Last updated: January 5, 2023 The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers should carefully review the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

This information allows us to give you access to content that varies based on your general location (e.g., nearby locations or delivery status). We will ask your permission before collecting your precise GPS location information. In such instances, we may use your precise geo-location information to provide customized services, content, and other information that may be of interest to you.

Online and Mobile App AdvertisingA. Online AdvertisingWe may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as  Google’s ad services, and others) on our Services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Services and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches and browsing activity. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Adobe Audience Manager, visit adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising, or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. To generally update your cookies settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to disable cookies altogether, please consult your web browser settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our Services.For additional ways to opt out of targeted advertising activities under applicable law, see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below. Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for each device—and each browser on each device—through which you access our Services. In addition, the opt-outs do not apply to advertisements in mobile applications. See the “Mobile App Advertising” section below to learn how to opt out of mobile app advertising.B. Mobile App AdvertisingWe may use third-party service providers to deliver ads on other mobile apps or for mobile app analytics based on your interactions on our platform.  Each operating system (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the use of advertising identifiers for tailored in-application advertisements. Because we do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for information on opting out of this use of your advertising identifiers.C. Notice Concerning Do Not TrackDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about Do Not Track. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.4.

This information allows us to give you access to content that varies based on your general location (e.g., nearby locations or delivery status). We will ask your permission before collecting your precise GPS location information. In such instances, we may use your precise geo-location information to provide customized services, content, and other information that may be of interest to you.

Online and Mobile App AdvertisingA. Online AdvertisingWe may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as  Google’s ad services, and others) on our Services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Services and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches and browsing activity. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Adobe Audience Manager, visit adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising, or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. To generally update your cookies settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to disable cookies altogether, please consult your web browser settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our Services.For additional ways to opt out of targeted advertising activities under applicable law, see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below. Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for each device—and each browser on each device—through which you access our Services. In addition, the opt-outs do not apply to advertisements in mobile applications. See the “Mobile App Advertising” section below to learn how to opt out of mobile app advertising.B. Mobile App AdvertisingWe may use third-party service providers to deliver ads on other mobile apps or for mobile app analytics based on your interactions on our platform.  Each operating system (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the use of advertising identifiers for tailored in-application advertisements. Because we do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for information on opting out of this use of your advertising identifiers.C. Notice Concerning Do Not TrackDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about Do Not Track. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.4.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyLast Updated: October 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyLast Updated: October 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyLast Updated: October 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy will be effective as of November 29, 2020, unless you agree to it before then. You can review our current Privacy Policy by selecting Version 2.0 from the drop-down menu.Last Updated: October 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using Snagajob Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use that allow us to process information about you.1.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyLast Updated: June 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using Snagajob Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use that allow us to process information about you.1.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyThe Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyThe Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using Snagajob Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use that allow us to process information about you.1.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyThe Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor.

In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers.

Snagajob Privacy PolicyEffective date: January 1, 2020The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

SecurityWhat we do to protect your personal informationAt Snagajob, we work hard to keep your information safe. Internal procedures include: Regular risk and security assessments Methods to prevent and detect unauthorized access Testing of components by internal and third party experts Real-time alerting and on-call response to issuesWe promise to: Keep your data safe and confidential Store your data encrypted Use industry-standard encryption protocols to protect all data in transit Protect our infrastructure and hold any providers we use to the highest expectations of physical access, control, and safety.Your Part – What you should doIn General: Never share your login information with anyone to any website Never use the same password for all your online accounts (Netflix, Amazon, your email accounts, etc.) and try to change your passwords every 2-3 months Do not fill out social media quizzes that gather information about you (your birth month, your high school mascot, etc.) – you can't ever be 100% sure of where that data is going and who could use it to try and hack you. When looking at a web address, make sure "https://" is in the URL. This means that the website you're visiting is secure and that all communication between you and that website is encrypted. We recommend using a passphrase instead of a password. Learn more by clicking here – NIST Update: Passphrases In, Complex Passwords Out Never send personal information (Social Security Number, driver's license, DOB, etc.) or credit card information over email or text message Learn how to spot a phishing email – FTC's guide on phishing  If you get an email from a business, verify the sender by hovering over the email address Check for spelling mistakes Don't ever give up personal or company confidential information – most businesses will never ask for personal credentials via email Beware of urgent or threatening language in the subject line Job Seekers – Common red flags when applyingIt can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a real job posting and a scam posting. After all, scammers tend to advertise jobs openings inthe same places that legitimate employers do.That’s why we’ve put together some tips to help you keep your information safe during your job search. Watch out for these red flags and you will be able to tell the difference between a real job and a fake: No work? No money. Do not cash any checks or accept any money if you haven't done any work. Job scammers often say they will pay you in advance for miscellaneous items like office supplies or personal items. These checks are not real and they        will bounce. If you are unsure, you can always go to your bank and have them confirm the authenticity of the check. Share your info wisely. Applying to many legitimate jobs online requires you to provide a lot of information, like your address or Social Security number. Just remember, never give out your information through email or over the phone. And always        check to make sure the site you are using to apply is secure. Stay organized. Some scammers will post a job under a legitimate company name, but then contact you as a different, fake company in the hopes you won't remember all of the jobs you've applied to. We recommend keeping a notebook or spreadsheet        that lists each position and company you send an application to and don't respond to anyone unfamiliar. Do your research. If someone reaches out to you from a company you've never heard of, do a quick internet search to check them out to see if others have been scammed by them. Also, keep an eye out for people who do not have a company domain        name in their email address, but instead use a free email service (e.g., XYZ@companyname.com vs. XYZ@gmail.com). Trust your gut. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Pay attention to the pay rate you are being offered and compare it to similar jobs in your area. If they offer to pay you $30 an hour to answer phones at home because their office        is under construction, let this be a red flag.What to do if you suspect you’ve been a victim of fraud Place an initial fraud alert - Ask credit companies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This will make it difficult for anyone to access your account and lasts 90 days.

Arbitration AgreementThis Arbitration Agreement (the "Agreement") is by and between Snagajob LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business at 4851 Lake Brook Drive, Glen Allen, VA 23060 ("Snagajob" or the "Company") and the person whose electronic    signature appears below ("You") (collectively, the "Parties") and is effective as the date you become an employee of Snagajob (the "Effective Date"). Snagajob desires your services, and You are willing to provide those services. Therefore, the Parties    agree as follows:  If a wage or employment classification dispute of any kind ("Dispute") arises related to the services you provide to Snagajob or to clients of Snagajob, any terms, conditions or other matters related in any way to your relationship with Snagajob (or        its successors) or its clients to which you provide services (or their successors), or the termination of your relationship with Snagajob, both You and Snagajob (and its successors, predecessors, benefit plans, directors, officers, employees,        supervisors and agents) agree to submit the Dispute exclusively to binding arbitration, including, but not limited to, Disputes arising under statutory law (including, but not limited to any laws related to employment misclassification, wage payment,        wage statements, minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, or any other wage and hour laws), and any other local, state or federal laws, excepting only claims which may not, by law, be arbitrated (collectively, "Claims"). This agreement to        arbitrate shall apply to any and all Claims, whether asserted by You against the Company and/or any other entity, including but not limited to any Company client.   Both You and the Company acknowledge that both parties are relinquishing their right to a jury trial in civil court. By signing this Agreement, the parties agree that arbitration is the exclusive        remedy for all disputes related to the matters discussed in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement.   The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator licensed to practice law and experienced in employment law, and administered by JAMS (or any successor) pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures and subject to JAMS Policy on Employment Arbitration Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness, except        as provided otherwise in this Agreement. Such arbitration shall take place in the county in which You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients. In any arbitration, the burden of proof shall be allocated as provided by applicable        law. Either party may bring an action in court to compel arbitration under this Agreement and to enforce an arbitration award. Discovery (e.g., depositions, interrogatories, document requests, etc.) shall be available to the Company and You as        though the dispute were pending in the state or local court where You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients. The arbitrator shall have the ability to rule on pre-hearing motions, as though the matter were pending in the state        court where You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients, including the ability to rule on a motion for summary judgment or other dispositive motion. The arbitrator's authority shall extend to determinations regarding the scope        or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate. Any party's right to appeal or to seek modification of rulings by the arbitrator is strictly limited by state law and the Federal Arbitration Act.   This Agreement shall not apply to claims for unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, claims under an employee benefit plan, the terms of which contain its own arbitration or claims review procedure, or claims which parties are legally prohibited        from submitting to arbitration, to the extent You are entitled to bring any such claims.   Nothing in this Agreement restricts You from exercising statutory rights to seek assistance through resort to federal or state enforcement agencies. However, if an agency issues a right to sue notice, binding arbitration will be the sole remedy to        the extent permitted by law. Should either party institute any legal action or administrative proceeding with respect to any claim waived by this Agreement or pursue any dispute or matter covered by this Agreement by any method other than the        arbitration described herein, the responding party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all damages, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of such action, including any appeal.   Claims must be brought by either You or the Company in Your or its individual capacity, not as plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding or as a private attorney general, and the arbitrator shall not        have the power to hear the arbitration as a class, collective or representative action. To the extent permitted by law, both You and the Company waive the right to bring, maintain, participate in, or receive money from any class, collective or        representative proceeding. In the event that an arbitrator or court determines a claim must be permitted to be brought as a class or in a collective action, then this agreement to arbitrate is null and void with respect to the claim(s) permitted        to be brought as a class or collection action, except for the waiver of jury trial found in this Agreement, and such class or collective action must be brought in the appropriate court system and not in arbitration.   The fees of the arbitrator and any other fees for the administration of the arbitration that would not normally be incurred if the action were brought in a court of law shall be paid by the Company. However, You shall be required to pay the amount        of those fees equal to that which You would have been required to pay to file a lawsuit in the state court of your residence. The arbitrator must provide a written decision, which is subject to limited judicial review consistent with applicable        law.   Except as otherwise prohibited by law, and except as necessary to seek entry of judgment (which is required to be done under seal, unless prohibited by the court) upon an award as required by law, all arbitration proceedings pursuant to or in connection        with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any and all filings, discovery, hearings, reports, disclosures, exhibit lists, witness lists, exhibits, transcripts, decisions, opinions and awards, and their contents) shall be kept strictly        confidential and not disclosed to third parties. In addition, all confidential or sensitive information, to the extent necessary to be disclosed to the arbitrator or exchanged between the Parties in connection with the prosecution or defense of        a claim or counter-claim or cross-claim, shall be disclosed only to the most limited extent necessary and if disclosed, shall be disclosed only after the Parties and the arbitrator have entered into an agreement further protecting such information        from disclosure to the public or third parties and taken any additional measures to guard and preserve the confidential nature of the information. Further, any disputes concerning confidentiality that cannot be resolved will be submitted to the        arbitrator prior to making any disclosures. This provision shall not exempt from discovery in any other or future action any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in, referred to, discussed in the course of, or in connection        with proceedings pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement waives or limits either Party's right to provide truthful information to or communicate in good faith with a federal, state or local regulatory or law enforcement agency, or        to prevent either Party from taking reasonable steps to investigate or obtain discovery related to any Dispute or Claim.   This Agreement is not and shall not be construed to create any contract of employment, express or implied, or otherwise alter the terms of your engagement with Snagajob.   This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Either Party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the FAA to compel arbitration under this Agreement        and to confirm, correct, vacate or otherwise enforce an arbitration award. For purposes not addressed by the FAA, this Agreement shall be governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without        regard to conflict of law principles.   In addition to any other consideration to which You are not otherwise entitled, including Your engagement with the Company and receipt of the compensation and other benefits paid to You by Snagajob, each Party's mutual promise to resolve disputes        by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, rather than through the courts or other bodies, is consideration for the other Party's like promise. The Parties agree that the consideration set forth in this Paragraph is wholly        adequate to support this Agreement.   This Agreement reflects the complete agreement between You and Snagajob on the subject matter of this Agreement. Neither You nor Snagajob should rely or are relying on anything outside of this Agreement regarding its effect, enforceability, or its        meaning, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or a portion thereof, is determined to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the provision or portion thereof shall be severed        and all other provisions not determined to be unenforceable will still remain in full force and effect. The agreement to arbitrate any Claim under this Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snagajob. This Agreement cannot        be modified or revoked except by an express writing signed by You and an authorized officer of Snagajob. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES HE, SHE, OR IT HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT, HAS ASKED ANY QUESTIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, CONSEQUENCES AND BINDING EFFECT, UNDERSTANDS ITS TERMS, AND ENTERS INTO IT VOLUNTARILY, WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR COERCION,    AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY PROMISES OR REPRESENTATIONS OTHER THAN THOSE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS AGREEMENT WITH HIS, HER, OR ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL, AND HAVING USED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THE EXTENT DESIRED.EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS THAT BY VOLUNTARILY ENTERING INTO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, BOTH PARTIES WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY A COURT OR A JURY AND ALL RIGHTS TO PURSUE CLAIMS ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS.
