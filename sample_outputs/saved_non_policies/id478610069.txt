Privacy Policy
Byron Katie International, Inc. (“us”, “our”, or “we”) institutes the terms of this Privacy Policy to ensure that personally identifiable information (“PII”) is maintained in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. The following describes how we collect, use, and share the PII obtained from and about individuals who use the websites located at https://instituteforthework.com and/or https://thework.com (collectively, the “Website”). The Privacy Policy detailed below applies only to information collected through the Website and does not apply to information that we may collect outside the use of the Website such as over the phone or by email or mail. By using this Website, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information you provide to this Website as described below. Please read this entire Privacy Policy to make sure you understand our practices fully.



Information Collected – We may collect PII for purposes related to our business, to improve the content of the Website and our services, or for any other commercial purpose. The only PII collected from you has been voluntarily submitted and provided to us through your use of the Website or in response to requests for information. We may collect such data for processing that is necessary for providing our services as carried out in our legitimate interests.

User-provided Information. When you use the Website, you may provide, and we may collect, PII. The types of information that we may collect include but are not limited to: name, address, email address, and phone number. PII also includes other information, such as geographic areas or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual.
Automatically Collected Information. When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including cookies. This “automatically collected” information may include IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the pages or content you view or interact with on the Website, and the dates and times of your access or use of the Website.
Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information, including PII, from third parties and sources other than the Website. If information from other sources is combined or associated with PII collected through the Website, this combined information will be treated as PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our services, including embeds and advertising technology.


How Collected Information is Used – We may use the information that is collected in a variety of ways in providing the Website, including, but not limited to, the following:

Operations. We may use PII to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all features of the Website, to provide the services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions, and to provide user support.
Improvements. We may use collected PII to understand and analyze usage trends and preferences, to improve the Website, and to develop new services, features, and functionality.
Communications. We may use PII to communicate with you for administrative purposes such as customer service, updates on policies or terms, transactions, and communication relating to services. You may opt out of receiving such communications at any time via a link in the email you receive or by contacting us as provided in the “Contact” section.
Cookies and Tracking Technology. We may use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Website through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize Website services; (ii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website; and (iii) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as number of visitors and pages viewed. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by you prior to the expiration date; a session cookie will expire at the end of your use of the Website when the web browser is closed. The Website may include third-party analytics cookies. Third-party cookies may collect information regarding your interaction and preferences with specific sites and applications through the Website.


How Information is Shared – Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not intentionally disclose your PII to third parties without your explicit consent. We may disclose information to third parties with your consent, as well as in the following circumstances:

Unrestricted Information. Content generated by you and posted to the Website is your sole and exclusive responsibility and we have no responsibility or liability for such content. Any information you voluntarily display on the Website to the public or members of the Website will be available to any individual who has access to that content. Further, search engines may index your user generated content such that it may be found on and through common search engines. We cannot and will not guarantee the safety or security of your user generated content.
Service Providers. In some events we may work with service providers who provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services. These third parties may have access to or process PII as part of providing such services. We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including: (i) compliance with reporting obligations; and (ii) business or marketing purposes.
Legal Compliance. We may disclose PII or other information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other government agencies. We also reserve the right to disclose PII or other information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend against any third-party claims or allegations; or (iv) protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others.
Change in Structure/Ownership. Information, including PII, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets and only if the recipient of the PII commits to a privacy policy that has terms substantially consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Testimonials. We may display personal testimonials on the Website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your first name and last initial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us as provided in the “Contact” section.


Your Rights – We respect your privacy rights and provide you with reasonable access to the PII that you may have provided through your use of the Website. If you wish to access or amend any information or PII we hold about you, you may contact us as set forth in the “Contact” section. You may further control your PII in the following ways:

At your request, we will have any reference to you deleted or blocked from our records. We may retain some information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe there is a legitimate reason to do so.
You may also submit a request to delete the PII we maintain about you by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact” section below.
You may control the Website’s use of cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of some Website services.
You may, at any time, decline to share certain PII with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Website.
At any time, you may object to the processing of your PII, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. You always have a right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities.
If you receive commercial emails from us, you may unsubscribe or opt-out at any time via a link in the email you receive or by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact” section. Please be aware that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process your request. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages, you may continue to receive administrative messages regarding the Website.


Third Party Web Sites – This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and not to the websites of partners, affiliates, or other third-parties. You may be required to accept additional policies prior to your use of links accessed through the Website. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Website. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.
Third Party Servers – Certain information stored or transmitted by us hereunder, including PII, may be stored, managed, or otherwise handled by third parties. You understand and agree that we are not liable, accountable, or otherwise responsible for information communicated to or through third party servers and you hereby release us from any associated liability or responsibility consistent with the indemnifications, liability limitations, and privacy policy included herein. If you are located in the European Union or European Economic Area, please note that we will not transfer your information, including PII, to a country outside of the European Union or European Economic Area.
Data Security – We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Credit card transactions and order fulfillment processed through the Website may be handled by established third party banking institutions and processing agents. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PII against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the PII in our possession. This may include, for example, firewalls, SSL technology, application-layer security features, password protection, and other access and authentication controls. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your PII has been compromised, please contact us at the address provided in the “Contact” section. If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.
Data Retention – We only retain the PII collected from you for a limited period of time as long as we need such data to fulfill the purposes for which it was initially collected, unless otherwise required by law. It may take additional time for your personal data to be de-indexed from search engines, depending on those search engines’ practices, over which we may have limited or no control. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolution of disputes, and enforcement of our agreements.
EU-US Privacy – We make all best reasonable efforts to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation framework as set forth by the European Union regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. We adhere to the requirements of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. We are hosted in the United States and by using the Website you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your PII in the United States and any other country where we operate. Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact” section.
California Residents – The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides some California residents with the additional rights listed below.

Right to Know. You have the right to know and see what data we have collected about you over the past 12 months, including:

The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.


Right to Delete. You have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (and direct our service providers to do the same). There are a number of exceptions, however, that include, but are not limited to, when the information is necessary for us or a third party to do any of the following:

Complete a transaction;
Provide you a good or service:
Perform a contract between us and you;
Protect your security and prosecute those responsible for breaching it;
