TABLE OF OUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES


1. Territorial Restrictions
The Services are controlled and operated from the                         United States and with the exception of Team Coco content and services, are                         intended for use only by residents of the United States. We do not intend to                         collect or store nor knowingly process personal data of users who are residents                         of countries outside of the United States. If you are not a resident of the                         United States, please do not interact with the Services or otherwise provide us                         with your personal data. To enforce our territorial limits, we may collect data                         associated with a device to determine a country from which the device is                         accessing the Services. If we receive data from your device’s location                         indicating that you are outside the United States, we may block your access to                         the Services from that particular device. If you attempt to access the Services                         when you are outside the United States, we will use your IP address for the                         legitimate interest of allowing or denying access to geo-restricted content                         within our Services.  If you disable such                         geolocation on your device and we have no other method of determining your                         location and whether you are within our service territory, then you will not                         have access to the geographically restricted channels on your device regardless                         of your location.
Team Coco podcast content is distributed                         by third party platforms wherever such platforms make such content available.
                        When you access the Team Coco content through such platform, the distribution                         platform’s privacy policy applies including with regard to any transfer and                         processing of any personal data.  If you                         provide any personal data directly to us through the Team Coco website or any                         interaction with Team Coco directly, you understand that your data will be                         transferred to and processed in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations                         may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such                         as the European Union. By using the Team Coco website, listening to Team                         Coco podcasts, or providing us with your personal data, you consent to the                         transfer and processing of personal data in the United States.
2. Personal Data We Collect
We collect data that is linked                         to or can be linked to a specific individual for the purposes described in this                         Policy, called “personal                         data” (sometimes also referred to as “personal information”).  Personal data may be provided directly by you                         to us or collected from you automatically                         through your service usage, or through cookies and other technologies. We                         also may receive personal data about you from third parties. We may also combine                         personal data we collect through our various Services. We treat indirectly identifiable data such as IP                         addresses and cookie identifiers as personal data where required by applicable                         law.                          
We may process your                         personal data to become de-identified, or we may assign to your data a random                         ID that is not associated to you directly without additional information (“pseudonymize”).
                        We may do this through a variety of means, such as by blending your data with                         data about other individuals, by hashing the data or otherwise removing                         characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. Such de-identified                         or pseudonymized data is considered non-personal to the full extent allowed by                         applicable law. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to                         re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable                         law such as to evaluate the sufficiency of our de-identification processes. We                         may use and share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our                         discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and                         marketing purposes. However, if we combine non-personal data with personal                         data, we will treat the combined information as personal data.

B.                            Device Data from Enabled Radios – Certain                         SiriusXM radios are enabled for two-way communications through a modem                         installed in the vehicle, including radios that use a combination of the                         SiriusXM satellite network and a wireless Internet connection, or directly                         through a voice over IP wireless connection in the vehicle (each of these an “Enabled                         Radio”).  Enabled Radios may transmit                         Device Data and your listening history or preferences to us, our service                         providers, and/or the automotive manufacturer when you use the Services.  Note, SiriusXM satellite-only radios are not                         Enabled Radios and cannot transmit usage, location or other information from                         the radio or the vehicle.

a.                             Vehicle Location Data. Some Enabled Radios are                         capable of transmitting the precise geolocation (latitude/longitude) of your                         vehicle when you consent to do so. If you access the Services through an                         Enabled Radio in your vehicle and your vehicle is configured to provide your precise                         geolocation information, you will see notice of the collection of precise                         location data on the Welcome Screen of the Enabled Radio prior to your first                         use.

                        is expressly indicated, you consent to us having access to your precise                         location until you take action to disable the geolocation data transmission.
                        Geolocation transmission may be disabled in your Enabled Radio’s SiriusXM                         System Settings or by other means designated by your vehicle manufacturer. If                         you disable precise geolocation tools and continue to use Traffic, Travel Link                         and related infotainment services while driving, we will be unable to provide                         you with the optimal functionality of these services.

This California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosures (“Notice”) supplements the information contained in the Pandora Privacy Policy and applies only to California residents regarding their Personal Information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), CCPA as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CRPA”) and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder. Terms used herein (including defined capitalized terms) shall have the meanings set forth in the CCPA, CPRA, and the associated regulations, and in our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Artist Marketing Platform Terms of Use.


Your Rights
Under the CCPA, California Consumers have the following rights, all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA:


Right to Know or Access – the right to request that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, share and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you;
Right to Delete – the right to request that we delete certain Personal Information we collect about you, subject to exceptions specified under the CCPA;
Right to Correct – the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you;
Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing – you may opt-out from the sale of your Personal Information, or from the sharing of your Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising and
Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information – you may tell us to limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information to purposes set forth in the statute, including for use which is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services.


More information on each of these rights is below. In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.  Please note to ensure the integrity of our systems and the proper fulfillment of your request, we cannot simultaneously process requests for access and deletion. Please wait until you are notified that a pending request for access or deletion has been completed before submitting a subsequent request for the second process.


Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information


As disclosed in the chart below, some of the personal information we collect may be considered Sensitive Personal Information under California law. This includes race or ethnicity, religion, and precise geolocation derived from a device and intended to locate a consumer. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Limit Use and Sharing of such Sensitive Personal Information, please submit your request here or send an email request to privacy@pandora.com.


Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share For Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising


We sometimes share personal information to third parties as disclosed in the chart below, which in some instances may qualify as a sale under CCPA. If you use us or tell us directly to share your Personal Information with a third party, that disclosure is not a sale.


We share Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, i.e. targeted advertising.


If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Opt-out of Sale or Sharing for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising, please submit your request here.


Cookie-Based Opt-Outs for Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising


Pandora engages third parties in online advertising practices, which may be considered a sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising, as defined in the CCPA and CPRA. You may opt out of cookies set by third parties by launching the Cookie Settings from the footer of our web pages. In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA and CPRA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies.  For more information, visit https://www.privacyrights.info/.


Right to Know


As a California Consumer, you have the right to know the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, our business and commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information, and the categories of personal information we have disclosed for a business purpose, the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, the categories of personal information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold, in the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. You also have the right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12-month period, or upon specific request, since January 1, 2022, which we will deliver to you electronically, in a portable format where feasible. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please submit your request here. You can submit up to two requests to know within a 12-month period. In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request. 


Right to Delete


California Consumers have the right to request deletion of the personal information about you that we have collected from you, subject to the exceptions set forth under the CCPA. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please submit your request at here.


Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted. 


If you are the master account holder of a Family Plan, deletion of your data may affect playlists and other content shared with the other accounts linked to your plan.


Please note that if you have an active Pandora account when you request deletion, we will not close your account. We will retain such information as is necessary to allow you continued access to the Pandora Service, maintain your contact preferences, and to service and manage your account. If you wish to close your account, please see this Help Center article.


Please note that even in light of a request for deletion, we are unable to delete information needed to:


Continue to provide service(s) if you have an active subscription to the Service, provide goods or services you’ve requested, complete a transaction or perform a contract;
Help ensure security and integrity;
Identify, repair, and debug errors that impair the Service, our systems, or other functionality;
Comply with legal or reporting obligations, including to pursue or defend legal claims, exercise or enable others to exercise any rights provided by law, enforce or comply with contractual obligations, respond to valid requests for information, and comply with or enforce applicable laws and regulations;
Enable other internal uses consistent with your expectations based on your relationship with us or the context in which you provided the information; or
Enable or enforce any other exceptions provided by CCPA or CPRA.


Right to Correct Inaccurate Information


California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Correct, you may do so directly online through your account or by contacting Pandora Listener Care at support@pandora.com.


Right to Nondiscrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights


California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA and CPRA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA and CPRA rights.


Verification


We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making. For your protection, you must provide sufficient information to verify your identity in order for us to fulfill a request to access, delete or correct personal information. Because Pandora collects limited information at registration, you must provide, and have access to, the email account associated with your Pandora account in order to complete the verification step. If you cannot receive email at the email address associated with your Pandora account, you will need to update the email address before submitting a request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.


Authorized Agents


If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a California Consumer’s behalf, please submit the applicable request pursuant to these instructions along with a written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request, authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name and the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your submission the nature of your request. Both your identity and that of the consumer may be independently verified before we fulfill your request. We may ask the consumer to verify their identity directly with us, unless as an authorized agent, you are acting specifically pursuant to a power of attorney under the California Probate Code. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request. For the safety and security of our customers, any specific pieces of Personal Information requested under a CCPA Right to Access request will be returned to the requesting customer and not to an authorized agent, unless the authorized agent is acting specifically pursuant to a power of attorney under the California Probate Code.

Users Younger Than 16

Pandora does not knowingly collect Personal Information of any users under 13 years of age and will not sell or share Personal Information of users between 13 and 16 years of age without obtaining affirmative consent.
