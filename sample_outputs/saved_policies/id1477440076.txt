      This app requests some sensitive permission to make the in-app functions       work properly. Photos/Media/Files, location, and other permissions may       only need for searching scanners, recording audio, and sending alerts       about the public safety in Police Scanner.

3. Information We Collect

      A. Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies. We use “cookies”       and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your use of       the Service and to provide you with interest-based advertising. For       example, we collect information about the way you interact with features       on our Site, how long you spend on certain pages, and whether you received       an error message on our Service. For more information, please check this       privacy policy of the relevant services.      

      B. Geolocation Information. We collect your geolocation data       when you use our Service. For example, your device may be configured such       that it shares your real-time location-based information with us. In       addition, the content you create or share with us while using our Service       may contain recorded geolocation information. Also, some of the       information we collect from your device (e.g., IP address) can sometimes       be used to approximate your device’s location.
    

      C. Device Information. We collect information about the device       you use to access or use our Service. For example, we may collect the       following information from your device: the type of device you use (e.g.,       mobile, auto, a smart home device, etc.); your advertising Identifier       (“IDFA” or “AdID”); network connection type (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, 3G,       4G, LTE, etc.); operating system and version (e.g., iOS, Android or       Windows); language settings in your mobile device; and your mobile service       carrier.
    

      D. Media Information. We may collect media information about you from       third-party applications or services available on our Service. ​​For       example, when you register for an account with us, you may do so by       choosing to connect your already existing social media account with our       Service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, etc.). We receive certain information       from your social media account depending on your permissions and which       information you have made public. We use this information to make an       account for you on our Service. Also, we might collect and share your data       with social media or other similar platforms, as well as our advertising       partners, so that you and other people can see relevant advertising on       that platform. For example, we may use the Facebook Custom Audiences       service and share your IDFA with Facebook so that we can: serve relevant       advertising to you or include you in a custom audience that we will serve       relevant advertising to you on Facebook; or create an audience of other       Facebook users based on the information in your Facebook profile. You can       opt out from Facebook Custom Audiences in your Facebook privacy settings,       for example, and other similar platforms may have equivalent opt-out       settings.
    
E. Certain Permission this app may require:


        Photos/Media/Files permission: To get the audio from police scanners to         be recorded on your device as needed.
      


      We assure our users that any user data obtained through the permission we       may need will not be shared or distributed without the user's express       consent, except as required by law. We take the privacy and security of       our users' data very seriously and are committed to complying with all       relevant data protection laws and regulations.

      B. Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information. We       describe our legal bases for processing throughout this Policy. Below is a       list of the purposes described in our policy with the corresponding legal       bases for processing:
    



Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes;



          provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement           with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;         



          processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to           which the Owner is subject;         



          processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public           interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;         



          processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests           pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
        




      In any case, we will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that       applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of       Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement       necessary to enter into a contract.

If you would like to exercise       your rights under applicable law, please contact us at contact@policescanner.us.

          Right to Withdraw Your Consent. If we ever asked for your consent           to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw           your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the           lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties           based on consent before your withdrawal.
        



          Right of Access. Upon your request, we will provide you with a           copy of your personal information in our files without undue delay and           free of charge, unless we permitted by law to charge a fee. Your           access may be limited to the extent it would adversely affect the           rights and freedoms of other individuals.
        



          Right to Rectification (or “Correction”). You may request to           correct or update any of your personal information in our files. We           may provide you with the ability to update some or all of your           personal information directly via the Services.
        



          Right to Erasure (or the “Right to be Forgotten”). Upon your           request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files           that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it           was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to           processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such           consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to           which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for           our processing.
        



          Right to Restriction. You have the right to restrict our           processing of your personal information under certain conditions.
          During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only           process your restricted personal information with your consent or for           the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the           protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for           reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when           the restriction is lifted.
        



          Right to Object. You may object to our processing at any time and           as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information           on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We           may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary           for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted           by applicable law.
        



          Right to Data Portability. If we process your personal           information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or           the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to           receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and           machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal           information directly to another “controller,” where technically           feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights           and freedoms of others. You right to data portability only applies to           personal information provided by you to us.
        



          Notification to Third Parties. When we fulfill your individual           rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction           of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant           personal information unless this proves impossible or involves           disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such           third parties.
        



          Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling. You           have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on           automated processing of your personal information, including           profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on           you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.
        



          Limitations to Individual Rights Requests. We may limit your           individual rights requests in the following ways:
        




Where denial of access is required or authorized by law;



          When granting access would have a negative impact on other's           privacy;         


To protect our rights and properties; and


Where the request is frivolous or burdensome.





          Transfer of Your Personal Information. We transfer your personal           information subject to appropriate safeguards as permitted under the           applicable data protection laws. Specifically, when your personal           information is transferred out of the Designated Countries, we have           the required contractual provisions for transferring personal           information in place with the third-parties to which your information           is transferred. For such transfers, we rely on legal transfer           mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or we work with U.S.
          based third parties that are certified under the EU-U.S. and           Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
