You will be given an opportunity to review this product-specific information before using these features. You also can view this information at any time, either in settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy/data.

What Is Personal Data at Apple?




At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. 





Your Privacy Rights at Apple




At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To exercise your privacy rights and choices including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from privacy.apple.com, you can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.For more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/kb/HT208501.

Apple’s Use of Personal Data




Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.

Power Our Services. Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting.

This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others. Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.If we learn that a child's personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.To exercise privacy rights for your child's information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com and sign in to their account.





Cookies and Other Technologies

These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.Strictly Necessary Cookies.

Other Cookies. These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.

However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News, Stocks, or in the App Store.

Your California Privacy Disclosures
While the disclosures on this page are intended to assist California customers in the first instance, they apply equally to any region where the specific service is offered, as we provide a single version of our software to our users.











California Privacy Rights
California consumers have a right to knowledge, access, correction, and deletion of their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. California consumers also have a right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by a business, and a right not to be discriminated against for exercising their California privacy rights. Apple does not sell or share the personal information of California consumers, as those terms are defined under California law, and does not discriminate in response to privacy rights requests. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit according to California law. 
Apple provides notice of our privacy practices in our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy includes what personal information is collected, the source of the personal information, and the purposes of use, as well as whether Apple discloses that personal information and if so, the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed. More information about how Apple handles personal information in connection with specific Apple services is presented in service-specific notices at or before your first use of the service and is available at all times on your Apple device or at apple.com/legal/privacy/data. To view a copy of the latest versions of the service-specific privacy notices and the California-specific disclosures, visit the California Privacy Disclosures page.
California consumers with an Apple account can exercise their rights directly or through an authorized agent by signing in to their Apple account at privacy.apple.com. If you are a California consumer without an Apple account and you or your authorized agent would like to exercise your privacy rights, you can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact, or by calling 1-800-275-2273. If you do not have an Apple account, Apple will ask you for information that we consider necessary to verify your identity for security and to prevent fraud. This information may include name, contact information, and information related to your transaction or relationship with Apple, but the specific information requested may differ depending on the circumstances of your request. If we delete your personal information, we will both render certain personal information about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal information.
Do Not Track
Apple does not track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Third parties that have content embedded on Apple’s websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Apple website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personal information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.
Notice for Minors
Apple offers interactive services that allow you to post content to share publicly or with friends. At any time, you can delete or remove content you have posted by using the deletion or removal options within our services. If you have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if you would like additional assistance with deletion, you can contact our Apple Support team directly at support.apple.com/contact. Although we offer deletion capability for our services, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the services.
