Privacy Policy






Our Privacy Policy
We take your privacy very seriously.  Our policy protects your privacy and limits what we do with your information.

Information Stored
We do not store any financial information on our servers.  The financial data and images you record in our apps are stored on your device only.  If you do however choose to backup your data via other services like iCloud, Dropbox or directly to your desktop computer then your data will reside there too.  This protects your financial information but should compel the user to backup their data in a means they see fit.  Doing so will protect from loss if something catastrophic were to occur to their device as there is no means of restore other than backups created by the user.

The only exception to the above is if you are using the optional Human Scan feature.  In this case photo receipts submitted for human scanning are stored on our private server.  Once your device is updated with the scanned information, the photo receipt remains on the server for a period of 3 days at which time it is deleted from the server.
