3. Use of Your Personal Data 

            We use Personal Data to provide you with services, to build features that will make the services easier to use, and to contact you. This includes a faster website experience, better customer support, timely notice of new services and special offers, and more relevant content.
        
Our legal basis to use your data, where one is required to be provided by applicable law, is as follows: 

(a) as necessary to perform a transaction; 
(b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as record keeping to substantiate our compliance with law);
(c) where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law; and
(d) necessary for legitimate interests such as marketing that you have not previously objected to receiving.


            In general, you need to provide the Personal Data in order to make a reservation and otherwise enter into a transaction with us, for us to provide you with travel reservation services, and as may be required for our compliance purposes in connection with such transactions, except in limited instances when we indicate that certain information is voluntary. Not providing Personal Data may prevent us from providing you with requested information and carrying out transactions. However, you can always exercise control over our use of Personal Data for direct marketing (click here for details)             and you can control the use of cookies on our site (click here for details).

When you provide Personal Data in connection with these types of services, you are providing such Personal Data to those business partners, which hold such Personal Data on our behalf.

Please refer to the websites of business partners for their Privacy Policies and other information.

Examples of such operations include sending and delivering postal mail and email, analyzing data we collect, marketing our services, handling credit card transactions and providing customer service. While the companies we engage have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, they may not use it for other purposes. Priceline requires these vendors to enter into confidentiality agreements and to agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy & Cookies Policy. In some instances we utilize service provider platforms to help us provide certain services, such as our career services provider.

In these instances, you will always know whose Privacy & Cookies Policy governs the collection and use of your Personal Data by clicking on the Privacy & Cookies Policy link provided.
        

Future Business Transfers: Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, Priceline may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that Priceline, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. In such cases, the acquiring company would be required to honor the privacy promises in this Privacy & Cookies Policy or obtain your consent to any material changes to how your Personal Data will be handled.
        

Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures: Priceline reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us: We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply Terms and Conditions applicable to the services, to protect us or others against fraudulent or inappropriate activities, or to otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of Priceline, our affiliated companies, our customers, or others.

5. Your Choices Regarding Our Collection and Use of Your Data for Marketing and Other Purposes

        Our site is operated in the United States. If you are located in Europe, Priceline.com LLC (“Priceline US”) participates in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework for Personal Data received in the United States from the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (“UK-U.S. DPF”), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) (collectively, the EU/EEA, UK, and Swiss Frameworks are the “DPF” and the Personal Data at issue is “European Customer Data”). Priceline US adheres to the DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce with respect to European Customer Data, including its Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

        With respect to cross-border data transfers from jurisdictions outside the US and Europe (i.e., the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and the UK), your Personal Data will be transferred to the US, a jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home jurisdiction. The cross-border transfer to the US is necessary for the conclusion or performance of your transaction, for the establishment, exercise, and defense of legal claims, and for other purposes to the extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent the provision of your Personal Data is not necessary for those purposes, or as otherwise permitted by local law, your use of the site or provision of any Personal Data constitutes your consent to the cross-border transfer of Personal Data and the other activities identified in this Privacy & Cookies Policy.
