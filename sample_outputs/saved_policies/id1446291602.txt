Other Information
 
What is the legal basis of processing?
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as in order to provide the Services you requested); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for record keeping to support compliance with tax laws); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for direct marketing or certain cookies); and (d) as necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business
 
generally, including maintaining the safety and security of our Sites). With respect to legitimate interests, given that we are a Business-to-Business (B2B) company, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about commercial contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities, as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.

Do our Sites honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?
Given the divergent practices of companies that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we do not respond to DNT signals at this time.
 
How long do we retain Personal Data?
We typically retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and upon request we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law.
