Making Requests to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising
To submit a request to “opt out” of “targeted advertising” you may click on the link “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” on the footer of our websites or you may choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). We will process the GPC signal as a request to opt out.
To appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights, you may email us at usprivacy@twdc.com.
